      "3. Dan Burn (£5.0m) of Newcastle, however, was a decent pick, delivering 6 points against Leeds.\n",
      "4. Richarlison (£6.7m) was touted as a forward leader but brought home just 2 points.\n",
      "5. Bruno Fernandes (£9.0m) was a strong captaincy option with a respectable 10 points.\n",
      "6. Chris Wood (£7.7m) was listed as a viable captaincy alternative but failed to deliver, scoring just 2 points.\n",
      "7. Erling Haaland (£14.1m), as always, was a top captaincy option and didn't disappoint with 9 points.\n",
      "8. João Pedro (£7.6m) of Chelsea was a decent pick against Fulham with 9 points.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In conclusion, my dear London fantasy footballers, your performance this week was a mix of rare brilliance and common blunders. For those who dared to defy the norm, you reaped the rewards. For the rest, perhaps it’s time to venture out of your spreadsheets and into the world of actual football strategy. Until next week, may your captain choices be bold and your chip usage be fruitful!\n"
