    "Looking at the player prices vs their points, you can comment on their performance and what was expected from them. Similarly for most chosen players, and most captained players.\n",
    "You could comment on how the least selected players performed, and make sure to mention which team(s) chose them and benefitted from it. Find the team line-ups in the teams dataframe given later.\n",
    "Comment on how well someone chose their captain (one should choose their highest scoring player as captain always). This information is present in the columns: 'Percentage contribution overall' and 'Captaincy effectiveness ratio overall'. A ratio of 1 means the best player chosen as captain. 0 means worst.\n",

    "You also have the rankings history of every team in a list. Eg. [2, 4, 3] means a team ranked 2nd, 4th, and 3rd, after the first, second and third GW respectively. It suggests a team's rise/downfall/consistency.\n",
    "MUST talk about most common strategy throughout all the managers in our league (i.e - fielded 3 or more players almost everyone else had, captained someone who almost everyone had, used a chip that almost everyone used, etc.)\n",
    "MUST give a shoutout to one or two managers who did something unique this week (i.e - fielded a player who no one else had who scored big, captained someone who no one else did got lots of points from them, used a chip when no one else did, etc.)\n",
